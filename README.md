# Predict Customer Churn

- Project **Predict Customer Churn** of ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity

## Project Description
In this project we have to test a churn_notebook.ipynb file we make two main file using that notebook file first is churn_library.py and second is churn_script_logging_and_tests.py all we have to do to follow best practices and avoid repeatition of code.

churn_library.py file contain functions which we have to test using the
churn_script_logging_and_test.py file 

To test the file we have to run command in terminal 
  python churn_script_and_logging_and_tests.py

this will start testing our churn_notebook.py file  and generate our model and saved image to images folder and save model to model folder. 

## Files and data description
there are 4 folders in our project and the remaining are files
  1. Data (Folder) : this folder contain our data which is bank data csv     file
  2. images (Folder) : this will contain our saved images
  3. logs (Folder): this folder containing logs file which tells us about   whats happening in our function
  4. models (Folder): this folder contain our saved machine learning        model.
  5. churn_notebook.ipynb : this is our notebook file which we use to generate our two file churn_notebook.py and churn_script_logging_and_tests.py
  6. churn_library: this contain function which perform some task 
  7. churn_script_logging_and_tests.py: this file is used to test the churn_library.py file
  8. conftest.py: when we are working with the above files we need some file in which we store variables and then we fetch it whever we need it and its scope is the entire directory
